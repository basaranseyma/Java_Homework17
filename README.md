# Divisible Numbers Average Calculator 
This Java program, developed as part of an assignment for [patika.dev](https://patika.dev), is designed to calculate the average of numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 4 within a user-specified range. The program prompts the user to enter a positive integer, processes the input, and displays the calculated average in the console. Since we were instructed to use **while** in the assignment, I coded it accordingly.
